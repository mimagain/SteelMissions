# EasyMissions - Mission config
# Any valid mission config file in the missions folder/directory will work. Feel free to categorize by file
# Each top-level key is stored on the mission item. Keep the keys short
# Because of the above, existing mission items with missing entries will not work
# For a full explanation and list of mission types, examples, and options, read the wiki and make sure to check default.yml
# This file can be deleted when you have another .yml file in the directory, it will regenerate when there is no valid mission configs in the directory

# Here is a mission that will utilize all possible options right now. Don't be afraid of how big it looks right now, it gets way shorter using defaults
break_stone: # Mission top-level key

  # Item display stuff
  name: "<gray>Stone Breaker</gray>" # Mission item display name
  completed_name: "<green>Stone Breaker (COMPLETED)</green>" # Name when completed, you can also use the placeholder [NAME] to add the normal name

  lore: # Mission item lore, there is a fair amount of placeholders available for you to use other than just this, check the wiki out to find a list of them
    - "<gray>Clear out the stone to make way for progress.</gray>"
    - ""
    - "<white>Progress: <green><progress></green>/<red><requirement></red></white>"

  completed_lore: # Lore when completed, [LORE!] in the first line will make it the normal lore but strikethrough
    - "<gray>You have cleared the path.</gray>"
    - ""
    - "<gold>Right-click to claim!</gold>"

  item_rarity: "COMMON" # The minecraft item rarity of the item (cosmetic only),
  item_material: "PAPER" # The type of item for the mission. It's recommended to keep this at paper and use item_model to change its texture to avoid issues, https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.21.11/org/bukkit/Material.html for valid materials
  item_model: # Custom item model, leave empty or remove if you don't wish to have a custom texture, you can use existing textures like minecraft:stone too
  completed_item_model: # Item model when completed, leave empty or remove to default to item model

# Above is a minimal working complex mission, feel free to just not include the settings you don't need so you don't clutter things up.
# Additionally, you can configure the defaults of a mission to avoid repetition. Check default.yml for that
